      My friend who designed it forced me to write here something. So with this
      blog, I wanna share my experience with
      <span class="claim__rainbow">meditation</span>,
      <span class="claim__rainbow">habits</span> and share things that changed
      totally my life. It is writing down my knowledge in order to systematize
      it and <span class="claim__rainbow">exchange knowledge</span>.
